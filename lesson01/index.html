        <h1>About me</h1>
        <!-- Section about my background, including where I was born and what school I attended -->
        <h2>My background</h2>
        <p>My name is Vince Reyes. I was born and raised in San Diego, US, which is a city that I have still only explored a little. I attended <span class="institution">Sage Oak Charter School</span> throughout elementary school, middle school, and high school. Currently, it is my first year of being a student at <span class="institution">San Diego Mesa College</span>, and I am majoring in engineering!</p>
        <p></p>
        <!-- Section about my three favorite hobbies -->
        <h2>My favorite hobbies</h2>
        <p>I like to do a small variety of things. For example, drawing is a hobby I do. Sometimes I draw traditionally, and sometimes I draw digitally; as to what I draw, I usually draw landscapes. I also like to play the keyboard; my favorite composer is Bach, and sometimes I like to play his music. Finally, my other hobby is coding; sometimes I code stuff that is game-related.</p>
        <!-- Section about two of the things I like to experience -->
        <h2>My favorite things to experience</h2>
        <p>Many of the things I like experiencing involves looking at nature. For example, one of the places I like to go to is called <span class="place">Chollas Park</span>, which has a lake, ducks, and very tall eucalyptus trees that are humbling to look at. Another thing I like to experience is looking at the sunrise. These things are simple, but I don't always experience them, and that's part of what makes them special.</p>
        <!-- Section about what I hope to learn from this course -->
        <h2>What I hope to learn from this course</h2>
        <p>During my last web development class, I learned a lot about accessibility, responsiveness, and common practices in making a website. These are especially things that I might not have been principled in by my own research. I simply hope to learn more about these aspects and reinforce myself even further.</p>
        <!-- This latter part of the webpage includes a list of languages I know and other elements -->
        <img src="graphic.png" width="125" height="125" alt="Drawn portrait of me">
        <p>Here is a <u>list of languages</u> that I know:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>HTML, CSS, & JS</b> - I have only learned a good portion of HTML and CSS during my recent WEBD152 class, and JavaScript is something that I have been exposed to in the past.</li>
            <li><b>C++</b> - I have been programming C++ for some years now, but not intensively.</li>
            <li><b>Lua</b> - I have a little less knowledge of this than of C++, but I still have confidence using it.</li>
        </ul>
